# go-PPSPP
Go implementation of the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol ([rfc7574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7574))

This protocol serves as a transport layer for video live streaming.  It is format-agnostic (can be used to transport any video format), and network protocol-agnostic (should be able to talk to any network protocol like tcp, udp, webrtc, etc)
